# FSG-Cones
This repository contains 3D Models of FSG regulation cones used in the Formula Student races

They are used for simulation and ML training.

Feel free to use them, modify them whatever. If you create exact cones or want to enhance anything, make sure you create a pull request!

## Warning!
The cones are by eye and in no means exactly what the cones in the regulation book are like.

# TODO's:

- Create cones with the FSG Black markings on them
- Create cones that have some imperfections, like black streaks and dirt

If you use the cones, make sure you star the repository so I can see who used them! :)
